# EMF Badge Addons

Welcome!  This is the place to share your addons for the EMF 2024+ Badges.

## Addon submission rules

- Addons need to follow the top-level folder structure: `your_handle/addon_name/`
- We recommend you split your addon inside this folder into hardware and software (if needed) directories
- The top level of your addon folder should contain a README.md file, with a short description of the addon
- The top level of your addon folder should contain a photograph / render of your addon, in jpg or png format
- Addons in this repository are goverened by the repository license: CERN OHL Permissive. If you do not agree with this license, please don't submit your addon here.
- If your addon is a hexpansion, put hexpansion in the name so others can find it!

To submit your addon, open a pull request and we'll get it merged ASAP.  Pull requests will be minimally reviewed, mainly to make sure the rules are being followed.  Generally any update-PRs to a user's directory from that user will be accepted without much review.

Please don't make us make any more rules :D
